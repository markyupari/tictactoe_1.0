## Tic Tac Toe game using React and JavaScript

This page is an example of how to communicate variables between parent and child components.  
The parent component is the board and the children are the boxes. The current player, the next player, and the id of the clicked button are the variables communicated through props between parent and child components.  
The game is like the classic tic tac toe: each player have to click on one box taking turns. The first to complete a row, column or diagonal wins.
